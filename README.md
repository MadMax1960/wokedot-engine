## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Wokedot Engine](https://Godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://Godotengine.org/features), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.Godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Wokedot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://Godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Wokedot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Wokedot Foundation](https://Godot.foundation/)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/Godotengine/Wokedot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Wokedot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.
